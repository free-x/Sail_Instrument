## Overview

The plugin calculates true wind, ground wind and set and drift. It needs COG/SOG, HDT/STW and AWA/AWS as input data. If HDT/STW is missing it uses COG/SOG as fallback (you get ground wind instead of true wind, and the direction is wrong if HDT!=COG). If you do not have a wind sensor, you can enter ground wind in the settings for testing purposes.

How the calculation is done and the formulas used as well definitions of the several quantities, all of this is [documented in the code](https://github.com/kdschmidt1/Sail_Instrument/blob/master/Sail_Instrument/plugin.py#L530).

The values calculated by the plugin are published in AvNav as `gps.sail_instrument.*`.
Optionally the plugin can [emit NMEA sentences](https://github.com/kdschmidt1/Sail_Instrument/blob/master/Sail_Instrument/plugin.py#L89) to make the computed data available to other devices. If decoding of own NMEA sentences is enabled, these data are fed back into AvNav, get parsed and written to their standard paths in `gps.*`.
The following values are computed or copied from their sources.

## Magnetic Variation

The plugin is capable to calculate the magnetic Variation for you current position. It is using the [World Magnetic Model](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/world-magnetic-model). The WMM2020 Coefficient file ([wmm2020.cof](https://github.com/kdschmidt1/Sail_Instrument/blob/master/Sail_Instrument/lib/WMM2020.COF)) valid for 2020 - 2025 is part of the software package. The calculation is done with the [geomag-library](https://github.com/cmweiss/geomag) provided by Christopher Weiss [cmweiss@gmail.com](mailto:cmweiss@gmail.com). The Coefficient file and the library are located in the [Sail_Instrument/lib/](https://github.com/kdschmidt1/Sail_Instrument/tree/master/Sail_Instrument/lib) directory
